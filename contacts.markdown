## Get In Touch

I’m happy to hear from you — whether it’s feedback, a question about a project, or a collaboration idea.

### Email

{% if site.email %}
<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>
{% else %}
I don't have a public email configured. To add one, open `_config.yml` and add a line like:

```
email: yourname@example.com
```

{% endif %}

### Quick Contact Form
