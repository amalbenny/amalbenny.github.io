## About Project ALYOD
The project A.L.YO.D. ( Adaptive Learning Yggdrasil Operating Domain ) was originally my attempt to build a self-sufficient AI program to learn and perform adaptive learning operation management system. Later it became a collective term for my research and development programs under the cadre of CAD Designs, Programming Projects, etc.

This Website is designed to help you navigate through my lifetime works and for more collaboration opportunities. ( Keep in mind: This Website is still in design phase, so not entirety of the content is accessible )
